Please DON'T USE THE CODE HERE TO MAKE PROFIT, OR RESELL IT TO ANYONE. This property belongs to freecodecamp founders and authors, and they have went through great lengths in order to make this website for free, and accessing those challenges are free as well. This website was made for educational purposes, please keep it free.
