As mentioned in the description these repo will contain all the challenges in freecodecamp (As many as I could do).
So far the challenges that have been completed are: 
1) Responsive Web Design:
    (a) Tribute Page. 
    (b) Survey Form. 

Other projects could be uploaded later upon completion. 
Please DON'T USE THE CODE HERE TO MAKE PROFIT, OR RESELL IT TO ANYONE. This property belongs to freecodecamp founders and authors, and they have went through great lengths in order to make this website for free, and accessing those challenges are free as well. This website was made for educational purposes, stop being greedy and keep it free.
