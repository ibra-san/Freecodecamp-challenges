<!--Brain storming zone. 
What is the landing page going to be about? 
----------------------------------------------
1) A Cars. 
2) VPN. 
3) Wood. 
4) Shipping.
5) Diet Food.

Have to make it a simple idea, that is all. 
The page will be broken down into 
1) Nav bar with in page links. 
2) The content I am actually selling, or planning to sell.
3) Small video explaining what I am selling. 
4) Offers, pricing and deals. 
5) Email newsletter subscription. 
6) Footer with copyrights. 

I think I will go with VPN. More convient. 
Things I need to do: 
- Import all the google fonts I want. 
- Get a good wallpaper for the project, or create simple wallpaper. 
- Make the website more phone friendly, and start with the make the
website more phone compatible, than PC compatiable, then work my way
into PC compatibility. -->
